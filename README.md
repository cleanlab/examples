# cleanlab Examples

This repo contains code examples that demonstrate how to use [cleanlab](https://github.com/cleanlab/cleanlab) with real-world models/datasets, how its  underlying algorithms work, how to get better results from cleanlab via more advanced functionality than is demonstrated in the [quickstart tutorials](https://docs.cleanlab.ai/stable/tutorials/), and how to train certain models used in some tutorials.  

To quickly learn the basics of running cleanlab on your own data, we recommend first starting [here](https://docs.cleanlab.ai/) before diving into the examples below.

## Instructions

To run the latest example notebooks, execute the commands below which will install the required libraries in a virtual environment.

```console
$ python -m pip install virtualenv
$ python -m venv env
$ source env/bin/activate
$ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

It is recommended to run the examples with the latest stable cleanlab release (`pip install cleanlab`). 
However be aware that notebooks in the master branch of this repository are assumed to correspond to master branch version of cleanlab, hence some very-recently added examples may require you to instead install the master branch of cleanlab (`pip install git+https://github.com/cleanlab/cleanlab.git`).

You may run the notebooks individually or run the bash script below which will execute and save each notebook (for examples: 1-5, 9-10).

Bash script:

```console
$ bash ./run_all_notebooks.sh
```

Instead of installing the requirements for *all* examples simultaneously via `pip install -r requirements.txt`, you can alternatively install only the requirements for *one* particular example by executing this same command inside of the corresponding folder. This will require that you have installed cleanlab (`pip install cleanlab`), and some examples may require you to have the latest developer version of cleanlab from github (`pip install git+https://github.com/cleanlab/cleanlab.git`).

### Older Examples

For running older versions of cleanlab, you can look at the [Tagged Releases](https://github.com/cleanlab/examples/releases) of this repository to see the corresponding older versions of the example notebooks. 

See the `contrib` folder for examples from v1 of cleanlab which may be helpful for reproducing results from the [Confident Learning paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00068).
