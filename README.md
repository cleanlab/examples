# cleanlab Examples

This repo contains code examples that demonstrate how to use [cleanlab](https://github.com/cleanlab/cleanlab) and how [confident learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00068) works to find label errors.

To quickly learn the basics of running cleanlab on your own data, we recommend first starting [here](https://docs.cleanlab.ai/) before diving into the examples below.

## Instructions

To run the latest example notebooks, execute the commands below which will install the required libraries in a virtual environment.

It is recommended to run the examples with the latest stable cleanlab release. See `requirements.txt` file.

```console
$ python -m pip install virtualenv
$ python -m venv env
$ source env/bin/activate
$ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For examples 1-5, you may run the notebooks individually or run the bash script below which will execute and save each notebook.

Bash script:

```console
$ bash ./run_all_notebooks.sh
```

For examples 6-8, please follow the instructions in the `README` of each folder.

## Older Examples

See the `contrib` folder for examples from v1 of cleanlab which may be helpful for reproducing results from the [Confident Learning paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00068).
