# cleanlab Examples

This repo contains code examples that demonstrate how to use [cleanlab](https://github.com/cleanlab/cleanlab) with real-world models/datasets, how its  underlying algorithms work, how to get better results from cleanlab via more advanced functionality than is demonstrated in the [quickstart tutorials](https://docs.cleanlab.ai/stable/tutorials/), and how to train certain models used in some tutorials.  

To quickly learn the basics of running cleanlab on your own data, we recommend first starting [here](https://docs.cleanlab.ai/) before diving into the examples below.

## Instructions

To run the latest example notebooks, execute the commands below which will install the required libraries in a virtual environment.

```console
$ python -m pip install virtualenv
$ python -m venv cleanlab-examples  # creates a new venv named cleanlab-examples
$ source cleanlab-examples/bin/activate
$ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively you can only install those dependencies required for a specific example by calling `pip install -r requirements.txt` inside the subfolder for that example (each example's subfolder contains a separate `requirements.txt` file).

It is recommended to run the examples with the latest stable cleanlab release (`pip install cleanlab`). 
However be aware that notebooks in the master branch of this repository are assumed to correspond to master branch version of cleanlab, hence some very-recently added examples may require you to instead install the developer version of cleanlab (`pip install git+https://github.com/cleanlab/cleanlab.git`). 
To see the examples corresponding to specific version of cleanlab, check out the [Tagged Releases](https://github.com/cleanlab/examples/releases) of this repository (e.g. the examples for cleanlab v2.1.0 are [here](https://github.com/cleanlab/examples/tree/v2.1.0)).

### Running all examples

You may run the notebooks individually or run the bash script below which will execute and save each notebook (for examples: 1-7). Note that before executing the script to run all notebooks for the first time you will need to create a jupyter kernel named `cleanlab-examples`. Be sure that you have already created and activated the virtual environment (steps provided above) before running the following command to create the jupyter kernel.

```console
$ python -m ipykernel install --user --name=cleanlab-examples
```

Bash script to run all notebooks:

```console
$ bash ./run_all_notebooks.sh
```

### Older Examples

For running older versions of cleanlab, look at the [Tagged Releases](https://github.com/cleanlab/examples/releases) of this repository to see the corresponding older versions of the example notebooks (e.g. the examples for cleanlab v2.0.0 are [here](https://github.com/cleanlab/examples/tree/v2.0.0)). 

See the `contrib` folder for examples from v1 of cleanlab which may be helpful for reproducing results from the [Confident Learning paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00068).
