# Development

This guide provides a checklist for contributing new cleanlab examples.

- Add your example's notebook and any relevant files in a folder

- Ensure that the notebook contains cell outputs and that they look as expected in Jupyter notebook and **on GitHub**. Note this is different than our tutorials in the main cleanlab repository (where notebook cells should not be executed)! Unlike the tutorials, we want examples notebooks to also look good in GitHub's viewer (which has limited rendering functionality, so avoid things like \<div\> that GitHub's viewer does not render properly). 

- Ensure that the jupyter notebook cells are executed in order. Additionally clear any cell blocks that are too large (eg. model training code that specifies accuracy for each epoch), it is ok if these do not have an execution number after being cleared.

- If the notebook takes a long time to run or is hard to auto-execute, add its folder name to the `ignore_folders` list in [run_all_notebooks.py](run_all_notebooks.py)

- When adding a new example, use `pip freeze` to determine the package versions that are used, then

    1. create a `requirements.txt` file in the specific example's folder, and add the notebook's dependency specifications there
    
    2. add the dependency specifications in the main `requirements.txt` file, ensuring that the new dependencies do not conflict with the existing ones

- Add the notebook to the [Table of Contents](https://github.com/cleanlab/examples#table-of-contents)
 table in the README, ideally grouping the newly added example with any other related examples
