    "    * `'prune_by_class'`: works by removing the examples with *smallest probability* of belonging to their given class label for every class.\n",

    "    * If true, forces numerical consistency of latent estimates. Each is estimated independently, but they are related mathematically with closed form  equivalences. This will iteratively enforce mathematically consistency."
