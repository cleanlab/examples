    "This notebook demonstrates a practical approach to active learning for training classification models with cleanlab. In active learning, we aim to construct a labeled dataset by collecting the fewest labels that still allow us to train an accurate classifier model. Here we assume data labeling is done in **batches**, and between these data labeling rounds, we retrain our classifier and combine it with CROWDLAB to decide what examples (i.e. datapoints) to label next round. We assume there are **multiple** annotators to label the data, but since their labels are not necessarily perfect, we sometimes wish to ask a new annotator to provide an extra label for a previously labeled example. This active learning with multiple annotators setup is more widely applicable than academic studies which only consider labeling one example in each round or being limited to a single (noise-free) annotation per example.\n",
    "\n",
    "cleanlab provides two useful estimates for multi-annotator active learning: (1) an active learning score quantifying how desirable it is to collect an additional label for every possible example, (2) accurate consensus labels for the previously labeled examples  that can be used for classifier model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to compute these easily for use in sequential active learning, showing how a classification model iteratively improves after (re)labeling examples for multiple rounds. Some examples in the dataset will have been labeled by multiple annotators, and not all examples have to have been labeled at the beginning. cleanlab's active learning score indicates if you should collect more labels for an already-labeled example (thus having a larger number of annotators label a potentially difficult example), or get a label for a potentially informative example that has not yet been labeled.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Establish consensus labels (for the already labeled data). Use them to train a classifier model and then obtain out-of-sample predicted probabilities for each example.\n",
    "2. Compute active learning scores for every example, which estimate our current confidence in knowing its true label.\n",
    "3. Collect additional labels for the examples with the lowest active learning scores. These are the most potentially informative examples whose true label we are least certain of. \n",
    "4. Repeat the steps above to collect as many labels as your budget permits.\n",
    "\n",
    "The accuracy of the model trained on the resulting dataset will generally match that of the same model trained on a much larger set of randomly collected labels. I.e. this is the most cost-effective way to train an accurate classifier!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we use a modified version of the [Wall-Following Robot Navigation](https://www.openml.org/search?type=data&sort=runs&status=any&qualities.NumberOfClasses=gte_2&qualities.NumberOfInstances=between_1000_10000&id=1526) dataset, with multiple data annotators who each provide noisy labels."
