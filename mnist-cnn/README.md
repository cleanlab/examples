# Training a PyTorch CNN model to find label errors in MNIST

This example demonstrates the use of the following experimental module below from Cleanlab:

- [cleanlab.experimental.mnist_pytorch.py](https://github.com/cleanlab/cleanlab/blob/master/cleanlab/experimental/mnist_pytorch.py)

The code is adapted from `cleanlab` v1 examples (see `contrib/v1` folder).

## Instructions

Start Jupyter Lab and run the notebook: `label_errors_mnist_train_cnn.ipynb`

It is recommended to use GPUs for training.
