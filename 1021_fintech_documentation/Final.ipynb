        "# Detecting Data Quality Issues in Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Cleanlab\n",
        "\n",
        "In this 5-minute quickstart tutorial, we will use **Cleanlab's Datalab** to detect various issues in a tabular dataset commonly encountered in financial applications. This tutorial focuses on the **Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset**, which contains thousands of transaction records labeled as fraudulent or non-fraudulent. The dataset includes features such as transaction amount and anonymized variables for privacy.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Cleanlab Helps Uncover:\n",
        "- **Label errors**: Mislabeled transactions, such as fraudulent cases incorrectly marked as non-fraudulent.\n",
        "- **Outliers**: Transactions with abnormal patterns that deviate significantly from the rest of the dataset.\n",
        "- **Near-duplicates**: Repeated transactions or entries that may distort results or impact model performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using Cleanlab, we automatically identify examples that are likely mislabeled or problematic, improving the overall data quality for better fraud detection performance. You can adapt this tutorial to detect and correct issues in your own financial tabular datasets.\n"
